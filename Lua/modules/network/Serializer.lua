Class: network.Serializer

Helper class providing support for serialization and
deserialization operations. It is basically an encapsulation
of the vstruct functionlalities.

This class will mainly provide the <writeStream> and
<readStream> methods.

It also provide support for pretty printing objects with its method
<print>.

This class inherits from <base.Object>.

Function: writeStream

Base method used to perform the actual write to stream 
operation. This method is used by this class and derived classes
implementation of write()

Parameters:
  schema - The schema to use during the write
	tt - The table of data to write (or self by default)
Returns: 
	The written stream.

--[[
Function: readStream

Base method used to read a schema from a stream. This is used in
this class with the <read> method and in derived classes.

Parameters:
  data - The stream to read from
	schema - The schema to use when reading.
	tt - the target table where to store the values.

Returns:
	The part of the data stream that is not read yet.

	-- Note here that the cursor position is 0-based and Lua is 1-based:
